# bpmn-visualization add-ons

`bv-experimental-add-ons` offers new functionalities to [bpmn-visualization](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js) in the form of add-ons.


## ðŸ“Œ Usage
<!-- ### ðŸ“Œ Usage in applications and projects -->

Install `bv-experimental-add-ons` and [bpmn-visualization](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/):
```shell script
npm i @process-analytics/bv-experimental-add-ons bpmn-visualization
```


## ðŸ“œ TypeScript Support

The `@process-analytics/bv-experimental-add-ons` npm package includes type definitions, so the integration works out of the box in TypeScript projects and applications.
`bv-experimental-add-ons` requires **TypeScript 4.5** or greater.


## ðŸŽ¨ Features

### Plugins

The plugins infrastructure provides a way to register extension points.

Example of use:

```ts
// use BpmnVisualization from addons not from bpmn-visualization
import {BpmnVisualization} from "@process-analytics/bv-experimental-add-ons";

const bpmnVisualization = new BpmnVisualization({
    container: 'bpmn-container',
    plugins: [MyPlugin]
});
// Retrieve the plugin by id. The id is defined in the plugin implementation
const myPlugin = bpmnVisualization.getPlugin<MyPlugin>('my-plugin');
myPlugin.aMethod();
```

#### Available plugins

- `ElementsPlugin`: provides all `BpmnElementsRegistry` methods for retrieving `BpmnElement` and `BpmnSemantic` objects.
- `OverlaysPlugin`:
  - let show/hide overlays created with `BpmnElementsRegistry.addOverlays`.
  - provides all `BpmnElementsRegistry` methods relating to overlays.

#### Writing a custom plugin

A plugin is defined as a class:
- It must implement the `Plugin` interface.
- Its constructor must satisfy the `PluginConstructor` type.
- It can implement the `configure` method to configure the plugin after construction.
- It can provide new methods to extend existing API or introduce new behavior .


### `BpmnElementsIdentifier`

Convenient tools to know the type/kind of BPMN elements.


### `BpmnElementsSearcher`

`bpmn-visualization`only provides APIs that take BPMN element ids as parameters.
However, there are scenario where the ids in the BPMN source/model have been generated and are unknown by the application.

Instead, the app knows the name of the elements. `BpmnElementsSearcher` provides a way to retrieve the ids of elements related to their names.

This is useful for example in "Process Discovery" scenario. The elements are identified by name only. Ids may be generated
and not fully linked with the name of the elements.

Limitations
- There is no guarantee that names are unique in the BPMN source. In case that there are several matches, `BpmnElementsSearcher` returns the first matching id.


### Available implementations for `Path Resolution`

**WARNING**: this is front-end processing. It's more efficient for this type of processing to be carried out in the backend.
Use it to bypass the limitations of the tools and algorithms provided in the backend.

The `Path Resolution` infers a BPMN path from elements known to be completed or pending.

#### `PathResolver`

As it is generic and covers general use cases, its capabilities are limited.

It only infers edges/flows given a list of flowNode/shape ids.

#### `CasePathResolver`

Provides path resolution for a single process instance/case.

It is an enhanced implementation of `PathResolver` with resolution options and returns categorized `BpmnSemantic` objects.


### `ShapeUtil`

Add new methods to the `ShapeUtil` class provided by `bpmn-visualization`.
