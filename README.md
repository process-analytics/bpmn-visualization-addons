# bpmn-visualization experimental add-ons

Experimental add-ons for `bpmn-visualization`.



## ðŸ”† Project Status

`bv-experimental-add-ons` is at early stage of its developments.

It provides experimental new features to use with bpmn-visualization.

Before the release of version `1.0.0`, there may be some breaking changes. We avoid these as much as possible, and carefully document them in the release notes.

As far as possible, we maintain compatibility for some minor versions.
