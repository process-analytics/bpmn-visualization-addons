## üîÜ Project Status

`bv-experimental-add-ons` is at an early stage of development.

It provides new experimental features for `bpmn-visualization`.

Before the release of version `1.0.0`, there may be some breaking changes.
<!--
We avoid these as much as possible, and carefully document them in the release notes.
As far as possible, we maintain compatibility for some minor versions.
-->

See the dedicated [README](packages/addons/README.md).

A live demo is available at ‚è© https://process-analytics.github.io/bv-experimental-add-ons/

`bv-experimental-add-ons` is released under the [Apache 2.0](LICENSE) license.  
Copyright &copy; 2023-present, Bonitasoft S.A.


## üöÄ Release how-to

When all updates have been completed, you are ready to publish a new release.

Go to the [release workflow](https://github.com/process-analytics/bv-experimental-add-ons/actions/workflows/release.yml) in GitHub Actions and run it by choosing the type of release.

This workflow will create a Git tag and trigger the publishing of the npm package.

Manage Milestone:
- **Note:** we always put issues related to a version in a Milestone whose name matches the version.
- Ensure the name of the milestone used for the new release version matches the name of the tag/version that has just been pushed. Renamed it if needed.
- Clean this opened milestone if some issues are still opened (move them to a new one or discard milestone from them)
- Close the milestone

Create a new GitHub release by following the [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release):
- Create a new [Draft release](https://github.com/process-analytics/bv-experimental-add-ons/releases/new)
- `Tag version`: use a value of the tag that has just been created
- `Name`: same value as the tag, without the `v` prefix i.e. if the tag is `v0.2.0`, the name is `0.2.0`
- Description
    - _Note_: use [release 0.2.0](https://github.com/process-analytics/bv-experimental-add-ons/releases/tag/v0.2.0) as an example
    - briefly explain the contents of the new version
    - if releavant, create a **Highlight** paragraph and add screenshots, animations or videos to make the changes more user-friendly
    - reference the GitHub milestone
    - make GitHub generates the [release notes automatically](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes)
- Publish the GitHub release
