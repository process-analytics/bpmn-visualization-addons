## üîÜ Presentation

`bpmn-visualization-addons` offers new functionalities to [bpmn-visualization](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js) in the form of addons.

`bpmn-visualization-addons` is being actively developed.
Before the release of version `1.0.0`, there may be some breaking changes.

<!--
We avoid these as much as possible, and carefully document them in the release notes.
As far as possible, we maintain compatibility for some minor versions.
-->


## üé® Features and Usage

See the dedicated [README](packages/addons/README.md).

A live demo is available at ‚è© https://process-analytics.github.io/bpmn-visualization-addons/.
The sources of the demo are available in the [demo](./packages/demo) folder.


## ‚öíÔ∏è Development Setup

Use the node version declared in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc). You can use a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): `nvm use`

This project uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces).

Install dependencies: `npm install`

Develop the lib and live update the demo: run `npm run dev:demo`. The demo is accessible at http://localhost:5173/

### Husky settings when using Node Version Managers

Husky runs the pre-commit hook before each commit to ensure that the code meets the standards.

On commit, if you use a Node Manager, the pre-commit hook may generate an `Command not found` error.
If so, create a [startup file](https://typicode.github.io/husky/how-to.html#startup-files) and add the following content (this example is given for Linux or macOS when using nvm):
```bash
# This loads nvm.sh and sets the correct PATH before running hook
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

- https://github.com/typicode/husky/issues/912

## üöÄ Release how-to

When all updates have been completed, you are ready to publish a new release.

Go to the [release workflow](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-addons/actions/workflows/release.yml) in GitHub Actions and run it by choosing the type of release.

This workflow:
- Creates a Git tag
- Triggers the publishing of the npm package
- Creates a draft GitHub release

Manage Milestone:
- **Note:** we always put issues related to a version in a Milestone whose name matches the version.
- Ensure the name of the milestone used for the new release version matches the name of the tag/version that has just been pushed. Renamed it if needed.
- Clean this opened milestone if some issues are still opened (move them to a new one or discard milestone from them)
- Close the milestone

The release workflow has initiated a new draft GitHub release, which needs to be updated and published :
- For more details about GitHub release, follow the [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release):
- The release notes has been [automatically generated](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes). Review and adjust it if necessary.
- Publish the GitHub release
