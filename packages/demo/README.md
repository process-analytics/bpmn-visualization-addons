Create a new GitHub release by following the [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release)
- for `Tag version`, use a value following the **vX.Y.Z** scheme using the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
- for `Target`
    - usually, keep the `main` branch except if new commits that you don't want to integrate for the release are already
