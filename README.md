We avoid these as much as possible, and carefully document them in the release notes.
As far as possible, we maintain compatibility for some minor versions.
-->

## üöÄ Release how-to

When all updates have been completed, you are ready to publish a new release.

Go to the [release workflow](https://github.com/process-analytics/bv-experimental-add-ons/actions/workflows/release.yml) in GitHub Actions and run it by choosing the type of release.

This workflow:
- Creates a Git tag
- Triggers the publishing of the npm package
- Creates a draft GitHub release

Manage Milestone:
- **Note:** we always put issues related to a version in a Milestone whose name matches the version.
- Ensure the name of the milestone used for the new release version matches the name of the tag/version that has just been pushed. Renamed it if needed.
- Clean this opened milestone if some issues are still opened (move them to a new one or discard milestone from them)
- Close the milestone

The release workflow has initiated a new draft GitHub release, which needs to be updated and published :
- For more details about GitHub release, follow the [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release):
- The release notes has been [automatically generated](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes). Review and adjust it if necessary.
- Publish the GitHub release
